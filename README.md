My p5.js Sketch
This project is a creative coding sketch made using p5.js.

Description
This project is a micro-scale plant ecosystem built around a one-button interaction. 
It uses a small corpus of personified plant phrases as its core dataset, and each simple input triggers layered growth responses within the system. 
The work explores the reciprocal relationship between acts of care and emotional feedback:every action not only alters the plants’ physical form but also prompts a linguistic response directed back at the user.
The plants never raise their voices, but they’re always honest with you: they need you, they depend on you, they appreciate you, and every now and then, they’ll show a bit of playful spirit.
